Feel free to leave your bags up front

Sit with space on either side of you...
 ...unless you sit in the first few rows down front

Crib sheets allowed -- everything else is off
                        and put away

Read (and re-read) the front of the exam answer
  sheet and exam packet

Write your name and RCS ID on the front of the
  blue answer sheet

  (Hand in ONLY the blue answer sheet; so make sure
    all of your answers are on the blue answer sheet!)

Write the number of diamonds on the blue answer sheet
  by counting the diamonds on the front of your
   exam packet (1, 2, or 3)

When you complete your exam, please quietly hand it
  in and gather your things

    No talking until you leave the room!  (please)
