TO DO:
(0) Read/review the syllabus and schedule

(1) Make sure you are in the course on Piazza with one or more emails

(2) Get Ubuntu up and running on your laptop and/or AWS cloud environment

(3) Get the C code examples to compile/run in your environment
    (make changes and see what happens...!)

(4) In C, write some code to read in (from a file or user input via scanf)
     a list of ten numbers (type double).  Store these values in an
      array.  Sort this list of numbers using one or more functions.

       (consider doing this in your favorite language first,
         then aim to port it to C)

    Rewrite your code and have it store a list of last names

(5) Write a C program to simulate caching:

    Interact with the user by repeatedly asking the user to input an
     integer; for each integer N, use a function to calculate the sum 1..N

    Pretend this is very expensive and you want to cache results

    Using only one array in C, implement a cache of values; the cache
     or array size must be 47 (though N will be much larger)




What is an operating system?  (one sentence only; don't use Google)

-- the intersection btwn the hardware and the software
-- a program that acts as the interface btwn hardware and (user) applications

-- a program that runs and manages other programs

-- a program that allocates and manages resources for other programs

-- a program that manages competing operations

-- a program that enables multiples programs to run concurrently

-- a program that provides enough abstraction such that users can
    actually use it

-- abstraction for programmers (i.e., system/library calls)

-- a (very) large-scale software system


What are the most important design goals or features of an OS?
-- fairness
-- reliability
-- stability
-- efficiency
-- use-ability
-- layers of control to provide abstraction
-- security
-- flexibility
-- extensibility
-- compatibility
-- predictability
-- consistency
-- portability
-- interoperability


Operating system services:

-- Resource allocation
   (memory management, process scheduling, disk access, I/O, etc.)

-- Program execution
   (load programs into memory, run/suspend/terminate programs,
    handle/display errors)

-- Filesystem manipulation
   (read/write/traverse filesystem directories,
    read/write/traverse files, enforce permissions/security)

-- Interprocess Communication (IPC)
   (processes exchange information via shared memory,
    message passing, sockets, pipes, files, etc.)
   (key challenges: synchronization)

-- Error detection and recovery
   (Detect errors in CPU, memory, I/O, processes, etc.)
   (Recover from errors gracefully)

-- Account and resource protection/security
   (Users, groups, account verification, memory protection, etc.)

-- Usage monitoring
   (processes, users, networks, log files, etc.)


Multiprogramming
-- In multiprogramming, several processes reside in memory at the same time
-- CPU is shared and managed by the OS
-- Addresses the problem of the CPU being underutilized
-- This introduces a new problem.....
   ...need to perform a "context switch" to switch the CPU's context
       from one process to another

Timesharing
-- Given a multiprogramming environment...
-- To ensure fairness, use timesharing in which the CPU
    cycles through all ready processes
-- Each process is given a fixed and finite amount of CPU time
    in which the process executes its instructions (CPU burst)
-- Switching from one running process to another is called
    a "context switch"
